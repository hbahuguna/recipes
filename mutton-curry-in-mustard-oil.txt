Ingredients: One kg mutton, salt, turmeric powder, mustard oil, ginger garlic paste, dahi, garam masala, potatoes, four or five big onions, green chillies, one big tomato.

Method: Lightly wash the mutton pieces, remove water and keep in mixing bowl. Do not over wash mutton. Sprinkle salt, turmeric powder, mustard oil and a little bit of ginger garlic paste, and let it marinate for a while. You can add a spoon of dahi too. The onions need to be thinly sliced. In a pressure cooker, heat mustard oil till it starts smoking and add all the Bengali garam masalas (cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and tej patta) and green chillies according to your taste. When they start splattering, add the chopped onions and saute till they are almost red. Now add the ginger garlic paste and stir well. Add tomato and fry till oil separates, then add turmeric powder, dhaniya and jeera powder.

Stir well and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the mutton pieces and stir well. Cook for at least 15-20 minutes by stirring occasionally. This is a crucial step. Next, taste and fix the salt. You can add a little bit of garam masala and pepper powder according to your preference. Add warm water to get the gravy. Now, add the potatoes. Generally, a big one is sliced into halves. You can fry the potatoes at the onset and leave them aside, before adding them at this point. Cover and cook on high flame till you get about 5 or 6 whistles in pressure cooker. Now reduce the flame to check the seasoning and adjust salt. Add some ghee to it if you want it rich.
